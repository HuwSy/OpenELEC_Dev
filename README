OpenELEC_DEV ; 

This is based on https://github.com/wavrunrx/OpenELEC_Dev with some changes to speed up the process and simplify.
This has reduced the functionality to now only updating to latest nightly build from one of three sources.
OpenELEC has an automatic update feature already built in, but its for going from one stable build to another.
If you like to live on the bleeding edge of new code, this script will make the whole update process a simple affair
normally requiring minimal input. It can be run off most available architecture provided the updates are in the 
available sources. These are;

http://milhouse.openelec.tv/builds/master/
http://milhouse.libreelec.tv/builds/master/
http://openelec.thestateofme.com/dev_builds/

The script has a mechanism which will always keep itself up-to-date, so you only need to download it once.
anytime i push an update it will replace the old version.
