OpenELEC_DEV ;
will update from one nightly build, to any current or past build you wish.
OpenELEC has an automatic update feature already built in, but its for going from one stable build to another.
if you like to live on the bleeding edge of new code, this script will make the whole update process a simple affair
normally requiring minimal input.

it can be run off any currently available architecture [as of 10/22/2012].
(ION, Generic, Intel, Fusion, RaspberryPi)

the script has a mechanism which will always keep itself up-to-date, so you only need to download it once.
anytime i push an update, you will have the option accept it or not. if you do, it will replace the old version
and restart itself automatically.

How to get it:

1) open a ssh session and run the following:


	curl https://raw.github.com/wavrunrx/OpenELEC_Dev/master/openelec-nightly_latest.sh > ./openelec-nightly_latest.sh && chmod +x openelec-nightly_latest.sh


2) now, run it ! (see below for available options)


	sh ./openelec-nightly_latest.sh

Options:  ./openelec-nightly_latest.sh  [-ioacrlsbvh]


	-i                   check if SYSTEM & KERNEL are already in-place; and suggest a reboot.
	-o                   list all avaliable archival builds for your architecture.
	-z                   roll back or forward to a version of our choosing.
	-a                   list all avaliable builds for your architecture.
	-c                   quick check to see if we're up-to-date.
	-r                   check the remote build revision.
	-l                   what's our local build revision.
	-s                   check for new script version.
	-b                   reboot OpenELEC
	-v                   script version.
	-h/--help            help.

NOTE:
As a general rule of thumb; using user built version's of OpenELEC (any build NOT avaliable on the OpenELEC development build server: http://sources.openelec.tv/tmp/image/) will seriously break usage of this script; i've built in some checks to look for this; but i can't possibly code for all the potential possibilities; therefore i need to leave some of the decision up to you:

IF YOU ARE USING ANY UNOFFICIAL BUILD THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON OPENELEC'S SERVER
(IE sources.openelec.tv/tmp/image/) THEN DO NOT EXPECT MY SCRIPT TO FUNCTION PROPERLY 
IT WILL MOST LIKELY BREAK YOUR SYSTEM. ONLY WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING AN OFFICIAL BUILD, SHOULD
YOU CONSIDER USING THIS SCRIPT.
