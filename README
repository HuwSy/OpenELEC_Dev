OpenELEC_DEV
will do everything for you required to update; and its interactive
it's compatible with any of the avaliable architectures OpenELEC supports.

the script has a mechanism which will always keep itself up-to-date, so you only need to manually download it once;
anytime an update is available it will replace the old version.


to run it, is simple:

1) open ssh terminal and run:
wget -O ./openelec-nightly_latest.sh http://dl.dropbox.com/u/66962/Repo/OpenELEC/openelec-nightly_latest.sh


2) give it proper permissions:
chmod +x openelec-nightly_latest.sh


3) run it !
sh ./openelec-nightly_latest.sh


* NOTE:
Do NOT manually change the VERSION= variable !
doing so will force the script to update itself with my working copy, which is constantly undergoing changes
and will most likely break usage.

i will change the version number on my end, when i'm comfortable with the code's condition.
don't change this ! in fact, there is nothing within the script that should be changed manually
