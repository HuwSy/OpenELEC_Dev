OpenELEC_DEV; will do everything for you; and its interactive.

it can be run on any architecture. (ION, Generic, Fusion, etc..)

the script has a mechanism which will always keep itself up-to-date, so you only need to manually download it once;
anytime an update is available it will replace the old version, automatically.


================================================================================================================


to run it, is simple:

1) open ssh terminal and run:
curl https://raw.github.com/wavrunrx/OpenELEC_Dev/master/openelec-nightly_latest.sh > ./openelec-nightly_latest.sh


2) give it proper permissions:
chmod +x openelec-nightly_latest.sh


3) run it !
sh ./openelec-nightly_latest.sh


================================================================================================================


Usage:  ./openelec-nightly_latest.sh  [-ioacrlsvh]

-i                    check if SYSTEM & KERNEL are already in-place; suggest reboot.
-o                   list all avaliable archival builds for your architecture.
-z                   roll back or forward to a version of our choosing.
-a                   list all avaliable builds for your architecture.
-c                   quick check to see if we're up-to-date.
-r                    check the remote build revision.
-l                    what's our local build revision.
-s                   check for new script version
-v                   script version.
-h/--help          help.

NOTE:
as a general rule of thumb; using user built version's of OpenELEC will seriously break usage of this script; 
i've built in some checks to look for this; but i can't possibly code for all the potential possibilities; 
therefore i need to leave some of the decision up to you:

IF YOU ARE USING ANY UNOFFICIAL BUILD THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE ON OPENELEC'S SERVER
(IE sources.openelec.tv/tmp/image/) THEN DO NOT EXPECT MY SCRIPT TO FUNCTION PROPERLY 
FOR YOU. IT WILL MOST LIKELY BREAK YOUR SYSTEM. ONLY WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING AN 
OFFICIAL BUILD, SHOULD YOU CONSIDER USING THIS SCRIPT.
